# 0.7.1

Bug-fix release.

## Fixed

- **Layout jump on first render** — `Orca(markdown = ...)` now performs a synchronous parse on first composition so the composable has its correct size from the very first frame. Previously the initial state was an empty document, causing a visible collapse→expand "jump" when items scrolled into view in a LazyColumn (e.g. chat message lists). Subsequent updates (streaming, edits) continue to use the debounced `LaunchedEffect` path.

## Upgrade

```kotlin
implementation("ru.wertik:orca-core:0.7.1")
implementation("ru.wertik:orca-compose:0.7.1")
```

No API changes. Drop-in replacement for 0.7.0.
